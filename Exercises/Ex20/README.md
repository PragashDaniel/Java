# Excercise 20

Java OOPS..
- Understand mutability and immutability in java
- Understand the difference between String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes in Java.
- Also understand appropriate usecases for the above classes.
- Understand difference between errors and exception.

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Goal of this exercise is to create a class which helps you to create a name for babies.
- Create a class called NameGenerator.
- Must have a method called String nameSuggester(int length_of_name).
- Functionalities, Dont store alphabets explicitly. 
- Use random numbers to generate the alphabets.
- From the generated alphabets concatenate the characters using StringBuilder class. Dont use String class in this exercise.
- If you want more methods feel free to create and achieve the goal of this exercise.
- Create a user defined exceptional handling mechanism if length_of_name == 0 and also for integer overflow also.
- Write the code in a modular fashion means convert most part of the code into methods, try to write clean code.

### Note: Random numbers generation should be carried out using a uniform distribution.

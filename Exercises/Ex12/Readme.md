Java OOPS..

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Initialize a random array or list of size 'N'(N should be atleast greater than 10,000 elements) you need to pass only in the constructor only once.

**Create a class called Stats and should have following methods with private access specifiers**
- Store the length of the array or list in a data member called count
- Create a method for mean {Params : input type = None , return type = {Float}} 
- Create a method for mode(Return the value with maximum frequency) {Params : input type = None , return type = {Float}}
- Create a method for variance {Params : input type = None , return type = {Float}}
- Create a method for Standard Deviation {Params : input type = None , return type = {Float}}
- Create a method for toString(Return should be like "No of elements:'count' ") {Params : input type = None , return type = {String}}

## Note
Fill your number using random number generator function between range of 1 to 100 from random number generator package

Java OOPS..

Especially Inheritance

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Goal is create a class to implement fraction addition ,fraction subtraction and fraction multiplication.
- Create a class called Fraction should have only two data members with type int and name should be numerator and denominator. Also the class should implement toString method which should meaningfully return the numerator and denominator as a string.   
- Base class Name it as Arithmetic class with following methods.
- - int add(int,int)
- - int sub(int,int)
- - int mul(int,int)
- Create a derived class called FractionArith from Arithmetic class must have following methods.
- -  Fraction fractionAdd(Fraction,Fraction) =>Internal arithmetic functionality should be extended from the base class Arithmetic.
- -  Fraction fractionSub(Fraction,Fraction) =>Internal arithmetic functionality should be extended from the base class Arithmetic.
- -  Fraction fractionMul(Fraction,Fraction) =>Internal arithmetic functionality should be extended from the base class Arithmetic.

Java Streams:
- Understand what is Streams in java and different functionality.
- Understand the difference between declarative and imperative programming paradigm. Identify under which category does Java streams will come.

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Create a class JavaStreamWorker.
- Create a  method odd or even function which takes input as a integer and return boolean true if the input is odd else boolean false.
- Create a method for cube of the given number input integer and output integer  
- Generate a Integer List of N elements fill the list with random integers.
- Create a method called List<Integer> process1(List<Integer>) use java streams to complete the task
- - Functionality => Pick only the odd integer using only odd or even function , sort the result in ascending ,return as list
- - Example [2,4,2,3,1] => [3,1] => [1,3]    
- Create a method called Integer process2(List<Integer>) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => Pick only the even integer using only odd or even function , ,return the number of distinct elements after filtering.
- - Example [2,4,2,3,1] => [2,4,2] =>  [2,4] => 2
- Create a method called List<Integer> process3(List<Integer>) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => Pick only the even integer using only odd or even function , map the filtered numbers to the cube function , sort the results and return as a list.
- - Example [2,4,2,3,1]   => [2,4,2] => [8,64,8] => [8,8,64] 
- Create a method called Integer process4(List<Integer>) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => map numbers to the cube function , return the sum of top 3 max numbers.
- - Example [2,4,2,3,5]   => [5,4,3,2,2] => [125,64,27] => 216

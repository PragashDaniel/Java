# Excercise 26

Java Collection:
- Understand Java Collections.
- Understand runtime complexities between different classes.

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Create a class called CollectionExercise .
- Create a array of 10 Integers using random numbers between 1 to 5 in the main class.
- Create a method called insertVal(Integer[]) 
- - Insert the integer array value into appropriate collection class using for loop.
- - Constraint: insertion order should be maintained.
- - Appropriate return type should be define by you for the above constraint.
- Create a method called insertValLIFO(Integer[])
- - Insert the integer array value into appropriate collection class using for loop.
- - Constraint: insertion order should be LIFO.
- - Appropriate return type should be define by you for the above constraint.
- Create a method called insertValFIFO(Integer[])
- - Insert the integer array value into appropriate collection class using for loop.
- - Constraint: insertion order should be FIFO.
- - Appropriate return type should be define by you for the above constraint.
- Create a method called insertValUnique(Integer[])
- - Insert the integer array value into appropriate collection class using for loop.
- - Constraint after insertion only unique value should be retained.
- - Appropriate return type should be define by you for the above constraint.       
- Create a method called insertValUniqueOrdered(Integer[])
- - Insert the integer array value into appropriate collection class using for loop.
- - Constraint after insertion only unique value should be retained and insertion order should be preserved.
- - Appropriate return type should be define by you for the above constraint. 
- Create a method called insertValUniqueSorted(Integer[])
- - Insert the integer array value into appropriate collection class using for loop.
- - Constraint after insertion only unique value should be retained and iterable should be sorted automatically.
- - Appropriate return type should be define by you for the above constraint. 
- Create method called int sizeDisplay(Iterable)
-  - return the size of the input.

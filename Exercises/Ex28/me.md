Java Lambda expressions and Functional interface:
- Understand Java Lambda expressions.
- Understand Java Functional interface.
- Understand Method references and its types in Java.  
- Understand Functional programming paradigm.
## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Create a interface called **Arithmetic** with a abstract method called **operation** with appropriate input and return arguments. Inside the main method,with the Arithmetic interface as a reference successfully implement addition , subtraction , division, multiplication and modulo operations using the lambda expressions.
- Create a generic functional interface called **ArithmeticGeneric** with a generic definition on both class and also on the abstract method which is called as **operation** with generic input and return arguments. Inside the main method,with the ArithmeticGeneric interface as a reference successfully implement addition , subtraction , division, multiplication and modulo operations using the lambda expressions.
- - For addition input type(Integer,Integer) -> output type(Float)
- - For subtraction input type(Float,Float) -> output type(Integer)
- - For addition input type(Double,Double) -> output type(Float)
- - For addition input type(Integer,Integer) -> output type(String)
- - For addition input type(Integer,Integer) -> output type(Double)

# Excercise 21

Java OOPS..
- Understand File I/O operation.
- Understand Java Serialization and Deserialization process.
- Understand the regex operations and  how to implement in Java.
- Understand Inner classes and its types.
- Understand File Exception handling.

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Goal of this exercise is to create a class which read data from a file called heart.csv and write the statistical summary in a another file.
- For statistical summary use the code from Exercise12 as a inner class.
- Create class called FeatureSummaryGenerator and define your own methods and also implement regex for string processing.
- So totally you need to use two classes FeatureSummaryGenerator and class from Exercise12.
- Design the class by yourself and also the methods properly to serve the purpose.
- File output should be in json format and also it should have a meaningful parameters.
- Also write FileException handling mechanism.

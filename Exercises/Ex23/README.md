Java Streams:
- Understand what is Streams in java and different functionality.
- Java Streams with objects

## Some basic definitions in OOPS world:

* Methods - Functions inside the class
* Members or data members - Variables inside the class

## Problem definition:

- Create a class called Student with two members student_name and student_mark and also use getter and setter methods to assign and retrive value.
- Create a List of 100 students like List<Student>.
- Assign randomized name for each student using exercise 19 and randomized mark for each student using random numbers between 1 to 100.
- Create a class JavaStreamAdvancedWorker.
- Create a  method odd or even function which takes input as a integer and return boolean true if the input is odd else boolean false.
- Create a method for cube of the given number input integer and output integer  
- Generate a Integer List of N elements fill list with random integers.
- Create a method called List<String> passMark(List<Student>, Integer passMarkThreshold) use java streams to complete the task
- - Functionality => return the student names in a list who are above the passMarkThreshold.   
- Create a method called Student firstRankStudent(List<Student>) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => return the student who is the topper in the class and print the details about the student.
- Create a method called Integer numberOfFailures(List<Student>,Integer passMarkThreshold) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => return the number of students below the passMarkthreshold value.
- Create a method called void printLastFiveStudents(List<Student>) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => print the last five values inside the java streams.
- Create a method called boolean checkAllPass(List<Student>,Integer passMarkThreshold) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => check if all the students above the passMarkthreshold.    
- Create a method called Map seperateStudents(List<Student>,Integer passMarkThreshold) use java streams to complete the task.
- - Functionality => Split the student based on passMarkthreshold values using partitioningBy() and return the results.
